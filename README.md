Gym App

Description: As a group of 6, we collaborated to create this app for our Software Engineering term project. The idea was inspired by the COVID-19 restrictions placed on the gym at Colgate University. For the two floors of the gym, there is a capacity limit with 20 people allowed in the bottom floor and 25 in the top. We wanted to create a website that tells Colgate students the current occupancy of the gym by floor, in addition to allowing them to get in line to use the gym remotely. Typically, when the gym is at capacity, students are forced to wait in the maine lobby for other users of the gym to leave. The lobby isn't large, which makes social distancing difficult during the busier hours of the day. The queue feature allows students to wait in line remotely and see when it is their turn to enter whichever floor they want to use. Additionally, while the queue being manipulated automatically updates the occupancies on the home page when the admin admits a user. The admin additionally has functionality on the admin page to manually manipulate the occupancy of each floor.
